# 📊 **Research Data Analysis Project**
_This project provides a comprehensive exploration and analysis of a dataset related to academic researchers. It aims to uncover patterns in research behavior, grant distribution, and academic output using statistical methods, machine learning models, and visualizations._

## **Project Objectives**
- **Summarize** and explore dataset features through descriptive statistics.
- **Analyze** relationships between variables using statistical tests.
- **Apply** machine learning models to predict research outcomes.
- **Visualize** key insights to communicate findings effectively.

## **Project Structure**
- 🗃️ **Data**: _Raw and processed datasets._
- 📓 **Notebooks**: _Step-by-step Jupyter analysis._
- 📊 **Visuals**: _All plots and graphs._
- 💾 **Scripts**: _Python files with reusable functions and models._

## 🔍 **Summary of Analyses**
### **Descriptive Statistics**
- *Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation* for all numerical variables.
- *Counted participants* per research field.
- *Examined distribution of research hours* per week.
- *Compared publications* across education levels.

### **Chi-Square Tests**
- _Association between gender and grant reception._
- _Relationship between education level and research field._
- _Grant distribution across research fields._

### **T-Tests**
- **Comparison:** Research hours per week between male and female researchers.
- **Investigation:** Math score differences between grant recipients and non-recipients.
- **Evaluation:** Publication differences between PhD and Master's degree holders.

## 🔢 **Machine Learning Models**
### 🏆 **Logistic Regression**
- **Goal**: Predict likelihood of receiving a research grant.
- **Metrics Evaluated**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Visualization**: _Decision rules leading to grant allocation._
- **Interpretability**: _Limited tree depth to explain variable importance._

## 📷 **Visualizations**
- **Histogram**: Research Hours Distribution.
- **Scatter Plot**: Experience vs. Publications.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Researcher Groupings.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Relationship Strengths.
- **Bar Chart**: Researchers by Field.
