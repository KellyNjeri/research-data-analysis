üìä Research Data Analysis Project
This project provides a comprehensive exploration and analysis of a dataset related to academic researchers. It aims to uncover patterns in research behavior, grant distribution, and academic output using statistical methods, machine learning models, and visualizations.

üß† Project Objectives
Summarize and explore dataset features through descriptive statistics.

Analyze relationships between variables using statistical tests.

Apply machine learning models to predict research outcomes.

Visualize key insights to communicate findings effectively.

üìÅ Project Structure
Data: Raw and processed datasets.

Notebooks: Step-by-step Jupyter analysis.

Visuals: All plots and graphs.

Scripts: Python files with reusable functions and models.

üîç Summary of Analyses
Descriptive Statistics
Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for all numerical variables.

Counted participants per research field.

Examined the distribution of research hours per week.

Compared the average number of publications across different education levels.

Identified missing values and duplicate records in the dataset.

Chi-Square Tests
Assessed the association between gender and grant reception.

Examined the relationship between education level and research field.

Analyzed if grant distribution varies significantly across research fields.

T-Tests
Compared research hours per week between male and female researchers.

Investigated math score differences between grant recipients and non-recipients.

Evaluated publication differences between PhD and Master's degree holders.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Tested if average years of experience differ by research field.

Compared math scores across different education levels.

Assessed if weekly research hours vary by field.

Simple Linear Regression
Explored whether years of experience can predict the number of publications.

Assessed the linear relationship between research hours and math scores.

Analyzed how well age predicts the number of publications.

Correlation Analysis
Measured correlation between research hours and years of experience.

Checked the strength of the relationship between math scores and publications.

Evaluated how grant reception correlates with research hours.

Feature Engineering
Encoded categorical variables such as education level into numerical formats.

Created derived variables for deeper statistical modeling.

ü§ñ Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Built a classification model to predict the likelihood of receiving a research grant based on academic and demographic factors.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Decision Tree Classifier
Constructed a decision tree model to visualize decision rules leading to grant allocation.

Limited tree depth for interpretability and explained variable importance.

üì∑ Visualizations
The project includes insightful visualizations for enhanced data interpretation:

Histogram of Research Hours: Distribution of weekly research hours among researchers.

Scatter Plot of Experience vs. Publications: Highlights trends with regression lines and color-coded categories.

K-Means Clustering Plot: Groups researchers based on experience and publication output.

Correlation Heatmap: Reveals strengths of relationships among numerical features.

Bar Chart of Researchers by Field: Shows distribution across different research areas.

Decision Tree Diagram: Visual explanation of the grant prediction model.
